# Chapter 12: Inside the Zeal Computer

**Part of:** Part III — Introduction to Systems & The Zeal Computer

---

## Overview

This chapter provides a high-level, conceptual introduction to the Zeal computer's hardware. You'll learn about the main components that make up the Zeal system and how they work together. This is a **conceptual introduction**—we'll explore the "what" and "why" before diving into the "how" in later chapters.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the Zeal CPU (Z80) and its role
- Learn about the Video System (FPGA) and how it accelerates graphics
- Understand Memory Paging conceptually
- Learn about GPIO, I²C, and UART communication basics

**Target Levels:**
- **GCSE:** Simple, visual explanations of hardware components
- **A-Level:** Understanding how components interact and why they're designed this way
- **University:** Conceptual foundation for deeper technical study in Part IV

**SuperPascal Features Covered:**
- Hardware overview (conceptual)
- Platform architecture understanding
- System component relationships

**Prerequisites:**
- Chapter 10 (Units and Modular Programming) - Code organization
- Chapter 01 (Introduction) - Basic computer concepts

**Estimated Time:** 1.5-2 hours

**Chapter Size:** 4 H2 sections, ~25-30 pages

**Code Examples:**
- Conceptual examples only (no implementation details yet)

**Exercises:**
- Identify hardware components
- Understand component relationships
- Trace data flow through the system
