# **SuperPascal**

### A Modern, Safe, Educational Pascal Superset for Retro Computing Platforms (8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit)

**Compiler • Toolchain • Standard Library • Game Engine • Educational Platform • Multi-Platform**

---

## 🚀 Overview

**SuperPascal** is a modern Pascal superset compiler and educational toolchain supporting multiple retro computing platforms, including the **Zeal 8-bit Computer** (Z80 @ 10 MHz), **Foenix F256x systems** (WDC65C816S @ 6.29 MHz, 16-bit microprocessor with 24-bit addressing), and **Foenix A2560M** (MC68LC060 @ 66 MHz, 32-bit system).

It revives classic Pascal’s clarity while introducing:

* A **hybrid OOP + Struct** model suitable for both teaching and systems programming
* **ECS-friendly data layout** for high-performance game development
* **Hardware-accelerated math**, fixed-point arithmetic, and a full trigonometry suite
* **Modern compiler architecture** with well-defined IR, ABI, runtime, and object model
* A **full game engine** + ZealIDE for offline learning environments
* A complete **36-week curriculum** for schools and universities

SuperPascal is simultaneously:

* A **research platform** for compiler design
* A **lab environment** for building 8-bit games
* A **STEM education stack** for classrooms without internet access

## 🧩 Key Features of SuperPascal

### ✔ Clean, Modern Pascal

* Deterministic semantics
* Beginner-friendly
* Single, unified string type
* Clear error messages & debug support

### ✔ Hybrid OOP + Struct Model

* **Records (structs)**: primary data carrier, optimized for SoA storage
* **Classes**: lightweight behavior containers with small vtables
* Ideal for ECS-driven game logic

### ✔ Game Development Built-In

* Tilemaps, sprites, animation
* Physics engine (AABB, gravity, velocity integration)
* Audio system (SFX, music, streaming, mixers)
* Scene system and scripting language
* Profiling, debugging, and error reporting

### ✔ Advanced Math Stack

* Fixed-point (`Q8.8`, `Q12.12`)
* Full trig suite: **sin, cos, tan, sec, csc, cot, arcsin, arccos, arctan**
* Optional Float32 for scientific computing
* Optional FPGA-accelerated trig and vector math

### ✔ Designed for Education

* 3 × 12-week teaching curriculum
* Teacher Guide v1.0
* Marketing + outreach materials for STEM adoption
* Offline-first deployment

## 🛠 Architecture Overview

### **Compiler Phases**

1. **Lexer** → token stream
2. **Parser** → AST (recursive descent)
3. **Semantic Analyzer** → symbol tables, type inference, hybrid rules
4. **IR Generation**

    * IR1: linear, low-level Pascal
    * IR2: optional three-address form
5. **Z80 Codegen**
6. **Optimizer** (peephole, constant folding, loop unrolling)
7. **Linker** → `.ZOF`, `.ZOU`, `.ZPK` bundles

### **ABI**

* Pascal calling convention
* `IX` frame pointer
* `IY` exception frame chain
* Class layout: vtable at offset 0
* Record methods lowered to free functions
* Large returns via hidden pointer parameter

### **Runtime**

* Page-aware heap manager
* No GC / predictable memory usage
* Debug checks (bounds, overflow)
* Intrinsics for hardware operations

## 🔧 Build Targets

**Target 1 — Host Compiler (Rust or C++):**

* Fast iteration
* CI integration
* Produces Zeal binaries

**Target 2 — Self-Hosting Compiler (SuperPascal → Zeal):**

* Long-term milestone
* Runs directly on Zeal hardware

## 🧪 Compliance & Testing

A complete **Compliance & Test Suite** (v0.6) ensures:

* Parser conformance
* Semantic consistency
* ABI stability
* Stdlib correctness
* Hardware integration correctness (ZVB graphics/audio/input)
* ECS and game engine behavior
* Performance baselines (60 FPS target)

This suite is required for any independent or alternate compiler implementation.
