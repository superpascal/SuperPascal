# Chapter 06: Arrays and Records

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand one-dimensional arrays and how to use them
- Master multi-dimensional arrays and matrix operations
- Learn about records (structs) for structured data
- Understand enumerations (enums) and tuples
- Understand lists and linked lists (singly and doubly linked)
- Understand matrix multiplication and its applications
- Apply arrays, records, enums, tuples, and lists to solve real problems

**SuperPascal Features Covered:**
- One-dimensional arrays
- Multi-dimensional arrays
- Records (Pascal-style and C-style struct syntax)
- Enumerations (enums) and tuples
- Matrix operations (addition, multiplication)
- Array indexing and bounds
- Record field access
- Enum operations (Ord, Pred, Succ)
- Tuple destructuring and multiple return values
- Hybrid OOP + Struct model introduction

**Prerequisites:**
- Chapter 03 (Variables, Types, and Expressions) - Understanding types
- Chapter 06 (Loops and Iteration) - For loops for array processing

**Estimated Time:** 2.5-3 hours

**Chapter Size:** 7 H2 sections, ~70-75 pages

**Code Examples:**
- Array declarations and initialization
- Array processing with loops
- Matrix operations
- Record definitions and usage
- Combining arrays and records

**Exercises:**
- Process arrays
- Perform matrix operations
- Create and use records
- Build data structures with arrays and records

## Notes

This chapter introduces structured data. Matrices are introduced early to prepare students for later graphics and game development topics. The hybrid OOP + Struct model is introduced here as it's fundamental to SuperPascal's design.
