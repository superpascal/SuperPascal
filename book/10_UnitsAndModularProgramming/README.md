# Chapter 08: Units and Modular Programming

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the unit system and how to organize code into modules
- Learn the difference between interface and implementation
- Master exported symbols and visibility rules
- Build larger projects using multiple units
- Understand unit dependencies and initialization

**SuperPascal Features Covered:**
- Unit syntax (`unit`, `interface`, `implementation`)
- `uses` clause for importing units
- Exported symbols (public API)
- Private implementation details
- Unit initialization
- Modular compilation
- Building multi-file projects

**Prerequisites:**
- Chapter 04 (Procedures and Functions) - Understanding procedures and functions
- Chapter 08 (Arrays and Records) - Understanding types and data structures
- Chapter 09 (Strings and Text Processing) - Basic string operations

**Estimated Time:** 2-2.5 hours

**Chapter Size:** 5 H2 sections, ~35-40 pages

**Code Examples:**
- Simple unit with interface and implementation
- Unit with exported types and functions
- Multiple units with dependencies
- Unit initialization
- Building a multi-unit project

**Exercises:**
- Create a utility unit
- Split a program into multiple units
- Build a small library
- Organize a larger project

## Notes

This chapter introduces modular programming, which is essential for building larger programs. Students learn to organize code into reusable units, separate public interfaces from implementation details, and build multi-file projects. This is a critical skill for professional programming.
