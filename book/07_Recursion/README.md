# Chapter 07: Recursion

**Part of:** [SuperPascal — How to Think Like a Programmer](../ThinkLikeAProgrammerBook.md)

---

## Overview

Recursion is a powerful programming technique where a function calls itself. This chapter teaches you when and how to use recursion, how it compares to iteration, and how to think recursively.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand what recursion is and how it works
- Learn when to use recursion vs iteration
- Master base cases and recursive cases
- Understand the call stack
- Apply recursion to solve problems
- Recognize recursive patterns

**Target Levels:**
- **GCSE:** Optional/advanced section (if time permits) - Simple examples
- **A-Level:** Essential - Dedicated chapter with practical applications
- **University:** Deep coverage - Theory and advanced applications

**SuperPascal Features Covered:**
- Recursive function calls
- Base cases
- Recursive cases
- Call stack understanding
- Tail recursion (if applicable)

**Prerequisites:**
- Chapter 06 (Loops and Iteration) - Understanding iteration
- Chapter 04 (Procedures and Functions) - Understanding functions

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

**Chapter Size:** 4 H2 sections, ~25-30 pages

**Code Examples:**
- Factorial (simple recursion)
- Fibonacci (with and without memoization)
- Tree traversal
- List processing
- Recursive vs iterative solutions

**Exercises:**
- Write recursive functions
- Convert between recursion and iteration
- Solve problems recursively
- Understand call stack

## Key Concepts

### Recursion Basics

- **Recursive function** - Function that calls itself
- **Base case** - Condition that stops recursion
- **Recursive case** - Part that calls itself
- **Call stack** - Stack of function calls

### When to Use Recursion

- **Natural recursion** - Problems with recursive structure
- **Tree/graph traversal** - Natural fit for recursion
- **Divide and conquer** - Break problem into subproblems
- **When simpler** - Recursive solution is clearer

### When to Use Iteration

- **Simple loops** - Iteration is clearer
- **Performance** - Iteration is often faster
- **Stack overflow** - Deep recursion can overflow
- **When simpler** - Iterative solution is clearer
