## Chapter Structure

- **01_UpdateStep.md** - Update step, game state updates, input processing
- **02_RenderStep.md** - Render step, drawing order, rendering pipeline
- **03_SynchronizingWithVBlank.md** - VBlank synchronization, frame timing, delta time

## Notes

This chapter teaches students the fundamental game loop pattern. They learn to structure their programs with clear update and render phases, synchronize with the video system, and handle time-based programming. This is essential for all game development.

**Connection to Part III:** This chapter provides detailed implementation of game loops and timing. For a conceptual introduction to game loops, timing, and VBlank synchronization, see Chapter 13 (How Programs Run on Zeal) in Part III.
