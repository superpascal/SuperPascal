## Introduction

This section deepens your understanding of decomposition and pattern recognition - two essential skills for breaking down problems and recognizing reusable solutions.

## Decomposition in Depth

### Breaking Down Complex Problems

**Strategy:**
1. Identify the main task
2. List all sub-tasks
3. Break sub-tasks into smaller parts
4. Continue until each part is simple

### Example: Game Development

**Main task:** Create a platformer game

**Level 1 decomposition:**
- Graphics system
- Input system
- Physics system
- Game logic
- Audio system

**Level 2 decomposition (Graphics):**
- Load sprites
- Draw sprites
- Handle animation
- Manage layers

**Level 3 decomposition (Draw sprites):**
- Get sprite data
- Calculate position
- Draw to screen
- Update frame

### Decomposition Patterns

**Common patterns:**
- **By function:** Input, processing, output
- **By data:** Player, enemies, items
- **By time:** Initialize, update, render
- **By layer:** Graphics, logic, data

## Pattern Recognition in Depth

### Recognizing Similar Problems

**Look for:**
- Similar inputs/outputs
- Similar operations
- Similar structures
- Similar algorithms

### Common Programming Patterns

**1. Loop Pattern:**
- Process each item in collection
- Apply to: arrays, lists, strings

**2. Search Pattern:**
- Look for item in collection
- Apply to: finding values, checking existence

**3. Accumulator Pattern:**
- Build result by accumulating values
- Apply to: sum, count, maximum

**4. State Machine Pattern:**
- Track current state
- Transition between states
- Apply to: game states, menu navigation

### Pattern Reuse

**Once you recognize a pattern:**
- Reuse the solution structure
- Adapt to specific problem
- Save time and reduce errors

## Exercises

1. Decompose: Creating a calculator program
2. Decompose: Drawing a game level
3. Find patterns in: Sorting and searching problems
4. Find patterns in: Game loop and menu systems
