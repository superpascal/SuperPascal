## Overview

This chapter teaches you advanced data structures that enable efficient solutions to complex problems. You'll learn binary trees, hash tables, graphs, priority queues, and how to choose the right data structure for your needs.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Implement binary trees and tree traversal
- Use hash tables effectively
- Work with graphs and graph representations
- Implement priority queues and heaps
- Choose the right data structure for each problem

### [02: Data Structure Selection Guide](./02_DataStructureSelectionGuide.md)
Learn how to:
- Choose between arrays and lists
- Select trees vs hash tables
- Decide on graph representation

## Key Concepts

### Binary Trees

- **Tree Structure** — Hierarchical organization
- **Tree Traversal** — In-order, pre-order, post-order
- **Tree Operations** — Insert, search, delete
- **BST Property** — Left < parent < right

### Hash Tables

- **Hash Functions** — Mapping keys to indices
- **Collision Resolution** — Linear probing, chaining
- **Fast Lookup** — O(1) average time complexity
- **Key-Value Storage** — Efficient data retrieval

### Graphs

- **Adjacency List** — Linked list representation
- **Adjacency Matrix** — 2D array representation
- **Directed/Undirected** — Graph types
- **Weighted Graphs** — Graphs with edge weights

### Priority Queues and Heaps

- **Heap Property** — Parent >= children (max heap)
- **Heap Operations** — Insert, extract, heapify
- **Priority Queue** — Queue with priority ordering
- **Heap Sort** — Sorting using heap structure

### Choosing Data Structures

- **Operation Requirements** — What operations are needed?
- **Time Complexity** — How fast must operations be?
- **Space Complexity** — Memory constraints
- **Access Patterns** — How is data accessed?
