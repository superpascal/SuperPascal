## Notes

**Game Architecture Overview:**
- **Scene-based** — Game organized into scenes
- **State management** — Each scene manages its own state
- **UI system** — Menus and buttons for interaction
- **Transitions** — Smooth scene changes

**Scene Types:**
- **Menu scenes** — Main menu, pause menu, options
- **Game scenes** — Level, gameplay, cutscenes
- **Transition scenes** — Loading, transitions

**UI Components:**
- **Buttons** — Clickable UI elements
- **Menus** — Collections of buttons
- **Text** — Labels and messages
- **Panels** — Containers for UI elements

**Architecture Patterns:**
- **Scene manager** — Manages scene lifecycle
- **UI manager** — Handles UI rendering and input
- **State machine** — Manages game states
- **Component-based** — Reusable UI components

**Educational Approach:**
- **Practical focus** — Architecture applied to game development
- **Code examples** — Implement complete systems in SuperPascal
- **Progressive complexity** — Build from simple to advanced
- **Integration** — Connect all systems together
