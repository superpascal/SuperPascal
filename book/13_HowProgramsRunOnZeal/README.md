# Chapter 13: How Programs Run on Zeal

**Part of:** Part III — Introduction to Systems & The Zeal Computer

---

## Overview

This chapter explains how your SuperPascal programs go from source code to running on the Zeal computer. You'll learn about the compilation process, how programs are executed, and the fundamental concepts of game loops and timing. This is a **conceptual introduction**—we'll explore the "what" and "why" before diving into implementation details in later chapters.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the compilation pipeline (Source → Assembly → Object → Executable)
- Learn how programs execute on Zeal (Zeal OS, runtime, hardware)
- Understand the game loop concept at a high level
- Learn about timing and VBlank synchronization conceptually

**Target Levels:**
- **GCSE:** Simple, visual explanations of how programs run
- **A-Level:** Understanding the compilation and execution pipeline
- **University:** Conceptual foundation for deeper study in Part IV

**SuperPascal Features Covered:**
- Compilation process overview
- Execution model
- Game loop concept
- Timing concepts

**Prerequisites:**
- Chapter 12 (Inside the Zeal Computer) - Hardware understanding
- Chapter 10 (Units and Modular Programming) - Code organization

**Estimated Time:** 1.5-2 hours

**Chapter Size:** 3 H2 sections, ~25-30 pages

**Code Examples:**
- Conceptual examples (no implementation details yet)

**Exercises:**
- Trace compilation pipeline
- Understand execution flow
- Identify game loop components

## Notes

This chapter provides the conceptual foundation for understanding program execution on Zeal. Students learn how their code becomes a running program and how the system coordinates execution. Detailed implementation of game loops and timing is covered in Part V: Game Development.
