# Chapter 04: Conditionals and Logic

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand if/else statements and conditional execution
- Master boolean operators (and, or, not, xor)
- Learn nested conditions and complex logic
- Understand case statements for multiway decisions
- Apply conditional logic to solve problems

**SuperPascal Features Covered:**
- if/else statements
- Nested conditionals
- Boolean operators and expressions
- case statements
- Conditional expressions
- Structured control flow

**Prerequisites:**
- Chapter 03 (Variables, Types, and Expressions) - Understanding boolean type and expressions
- Chapter 04 (Procedures and Functions) - Understanding code structure

**Estimated Time:** 2-2.5 hours

**Chapter Size:** 3 H2 sections, ~20-25 pages

**Code Examples:**
- Simple if statements
- if/else chains
- Nested conditionals
- Boolean logic examples
- case statement examples

**Exercises:**
- Write conditional statements
- Combine boolean operators
- Use case statements
- Solve problems with conditionals

## Chapter Structure

- **01_IfElseNestedConditions.md** - if/else syntax, nested conditions, else-if chains
- **02_BooleanOperators.md** - and, or, not, xor, complex boolean expressions
- **03_MultiwayDecisions.md** - case statements, multiple choices, pattern matching

---

## Learning Path

- **Before:** Chapter 04 (Procedures and Functions)
- **After:** Chapter 06 (Loops and Iteration)

---

## Notes

This chapter introduces control flow - the ability to make decisions in code. Students should understand boolean logic before moving to loops, which also use conditionals.
