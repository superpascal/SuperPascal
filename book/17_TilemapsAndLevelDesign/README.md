- Learn level design principles

**SuperPascal Features Covered:**
- Tilemap DSL (Domain-Specific Language)
- ROW function for tilemap definition
- Tile legends and character mapping
- Tile collision detection
- Scrolling and camera systems

**Prerequisites:**
- Chapter 11 (Graphics) - Understanding tiles and video memory
- Chapter 18 (Entity Component System) - ECS concepts
- Chapter 17 (Game Loop) - Update and render loops

**Estimated Time:** 2.5-3 hours

**Chapter Size:** 3 H2 sections, ~25-30 pages

**Code Examples:**
- Creating tilemaps with DSL
