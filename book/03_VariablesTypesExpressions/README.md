# Chapter 02: Variables, Types, and Expressions

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand primitive types in SuperPascal
- Learn how to declare and use variables
- Master arithmetic operations and operators
- Understand type safety and conversions
- Learn about fixed-point types (Q8.8, Q12.12)

**SuperPascal Features Covered:**
- Primitive types (integer, byte, boolean, char, string)
- Fixed-point types (Q8.8, Q12.12)
- Variable declarations and assignments
- Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators
- Type safety and conversions
- Memory model visualization

**Prerequisites:**
- Chapter 01 (Introduction) - Understanding programs and algorithms

**Estimated Time:** 2-2.5 hours

**Chapter Size:** 3 H2 sections, ~20-25 pages

**Code Examples:**
- Variable declarations
- Arithmetic operations
- Type conversions
- Fixed-point math examples

**Exercises:**
- Declare and use variables
- Perform calculations
- Work with different types
- Use fixed-point arithmetic

## Chapter Structure

- **01_PrimitiveTypes.md** - Integer, byte, boolean, char, string types (with memory metaphor)
- **02_VariablesAndAssignment.md** - Variable declarations, assignments, scope (with "Variables Are Named Boxes" section)
- **03_ArithmeticAndOperators.md** - Arithmetic, comparison, logical operators, expressions
- **04_ExpressionsAndTheALU.md** - Expressions and the ALU (beginner-friendly introduction) (NEW)

## Learning Path

- **Before:** Chapter 02 (Computational Thinking)
- **After:** Chapter 04 (Procedures and Functions)

## Notes

This chapter establishes the foundation of the type system. Students should understand types before moving to more complex concepts. Fixed-point types are introduced early as they're important for game development.
