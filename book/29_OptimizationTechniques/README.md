## Chapter Structure

### [01: Optimization Techniques](./01_OptimizationTechniques.md)
Learn how to:
- Choose efficient algorithms
- Optimize loop operations
- Cache results to avoid redundant calculations
- Select appropriate data structures
- Use Structure-of-Arrays (SoA) for cache performance
- Implement object pooling
- Profile code to find bottlenecks
- Apply platform-specific optimizations
