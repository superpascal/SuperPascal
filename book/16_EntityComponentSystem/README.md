# Chapter 16: Entity Component System

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture
- Learn how entities work as IDs
- Understand components as data containers
- Master systems as loops that process components
- Learn Structure-of-Arrays (SoA) storage
- Understand ECS benefits and patterns

**SuperPascal Features Covered:**
- Entity IDs (`TEntityID`)
- Component records
- Structure-of-Arrays (SoA) storage
- System loops
- Entity management intrinsics
- Component access intrinsics

**Prerequisites:**
- Chapter 08 (Arrays and Records) - Understanding arrays and records
- Chapter 17 (Game Loop and Time-Based Programming) - Update/render loops
- Chapter 16 (Input, State, and Interaction) - State management

**Estimated Time:** 3-3.5 hours

**Chapter Size:** 3 H2 sections, ~30-35 pages

**Code Examples:**
- Creating and managing entities
- Defining components
- Implementing systems
- SoA storage patterns
- Complete ECS example

**Exercises:**
- Create entities and components
