# Chapter 05: Loops and Iteration

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand while loops and when to use them
- Learn repeat-until loops and their differences
- Master for loops for counting and iteration
- Understand loop control and when to break/continue
- Apply loops to solve repetitive problems

**SuperPascal Features Covered:**
- while loops
- repeat-until loops
- for loops (to and downto)
- Loop control (break, continue if supported)
- Nested loops
- Frame-based thinking for game loops

**Prerequisites:**
- Chapter 05 (Conditionals and Logic) - Understanding conditions and boolean expressions

**Estimated Time:** 2-2.5 hours

**Chapter Size:** 3 H2 sections, ~20-25 pages

**Code Examples:**
- Counting loops
- Conditional loops
- Nested loops
- Game loop examples
- Iteration patterns

**Exercises:**
- Write different types of loops
- Use loops to process arrays
- Create game loops
- Solve problems with iteration

## Chapter Structure

- **01_WhileLoops.md** - while loop syntax, conditional repetition, loop control
- **02_RepeatUntilLoops.md** - repeat-until syntax, differences from while, when to use
- **03_ForLoops.md** - for loops, counting, iterating arrays, nested loops

## Learning Path

- **Before:** Chapter 05 (Conditionals and Logic)
- **After:** Chapter 08 (Arrays and Records)

## Notes

This chapter introduces repetition - one of the most powerful concepts in programming. Students should understand all three loop types and when to use each. Game loops are introduced here as they're fundamental to game development.
