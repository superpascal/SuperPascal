## Key Concepts

### Computational Thinking Pillars

1. **Decomposition** - Breaking complex problems into smaller, manageable parts
2. **Pattern Recognition** - Identifying similarities and patterns
3. **Abstraction** - Removing unnecessary details to focus on essentials
4. **Algorithm Design** - Creating step-by-step solutions

### Problem-Solving Process

1. **Understand** - What is the problem asking?
2. **Plan** - How will we solve it?
3. **Implement** - Write the code
4. **Test** - Does it work?
5. **Refine** - Can we improve it?

### Why Computational Thinking Matters

- **Transferable Skills** - Applies beyond programming
- **Problem-Solving** - Essential for complex problems
- **Systematic Approach** - Reduces errors and confusion
- **Foundation** - Underlies all programming concepts
