# Chapter 21: Scripting and Events

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand scripting systems in games
- Learn script syntax and commands
- Master WAIT, MOVE, and ANIM commands
- Understand event triggers and handlers
- Create scripted sequences and cutscenes

**SuperPascal Features Covered:**

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

**Chapter Size:** 3 H2 sections, ~30-35 pages total

**Code Examples:**
- Script syntax
- WAIT/MOVE/ANIM commands
- Event triggers
- Script execution
- Cutscene examples

**Exercises:**
- Create simple scripts
- Implement WAIT/MOVE/ANIM

## Notes

**Scripting System Overview:**
- **Script-based sequences** — Cutscenes, events, animations
- **Command-based syntax** — Simple, readable commands
- **Event-driven** — Scripts triggered by game events
- **Non-blocking** — Scripts run alongside game loop

**Script Types:**
- **Cutscene scripts** — Story sequences, dialogue
- **Event scripts** — Triggered by game events
- **Animation scripts** — Complex animations
- **AI scripts** — Entity behavior

**Script Commands:**
- **WAIT** — Wait for time or condition
- **MOVE** — Move entity to position
- **ANIM** — Play animation
- **SFX** — Play sound effect
- **MUSIC** — Play music
- **TEXT** — Display text
- **IF** — Conditional execution

**Educational Approach:**
- **Practical focus** — Scripting applied to game development
- **Code examples** — Implement scripting systems in SuperPascal
- **Integration** — Connect scripts to game events
- **Progressive complexity** — Build from simple to advanced
