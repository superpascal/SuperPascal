# Chapter 09: Graphics

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand how the video system works on retro platforms
- Learn to draw shapes, tiles, and sprites
- Master basic animation techniques
- Understand frame synchronization and VBlank

**SuperPascal Features Covered:**
- Graphics intrinsics (`WaitVBlank`, `SpriteSet`, `SpriteShow`)
- Platform-specific graphics (ZVB for ZealZ80, VICKY for Foenix)
- Video memory access
- Sprite manipulation
- Animation loops

**Prerequisites:**
- Chapter 06 (Loops and Iteration) - Understanding loops
- Chapter 08 (Arrays and Records) - Understanding data structures
- Chapter 10 (Units and Modular Programming) - Code organization
- Chapter 12 (Inside the Zeal Computer) - Conceptual understanding of video system (Part III)

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

**Chapter Size:** 3 H2 sections, ~30-35 pages

**Code Examples:**
- Initialize video system
- Draw pixels and shapes
- Display sprites
- Simple animation
- Frame synchronization

**Exercises:**
- Draw a simple shape
- Create a sprite animation
- Build a scrolling background
- Implement a simple game loop

## Notes

This chapter introduces graphics programming, which is essential for game development. Students learn how retro video systems work, how to draw graphics, and how to create animations. This builds the foundation for later game development chapters.

**Connection to Part III:** This chapter provides detailed implementation of graphics programming. For a conceptual introduction to the video system and hardware, see Chapter 12 (Inside the Zeal Computer) in Part III.
